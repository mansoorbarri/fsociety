never felt so ready to die, dk whats wrong. everyday feels like i should just till my eyeballs dry and die. no one listens or understand why am i miles away here where everyone is soo alien to me either be by age or any other way even my family doesn't support no one fkn understands. im done lekin cant go like this too i jsut want some peace where i can stay here without the paranio of being raped, stay here without wearing earphones and hear the air cross my head, be here without shouting or having this hate for them. i wanna kill them at tim- most of the time. they wont take responsbility for ruining me or taimoor. they don't take account the mental pressure and pain it is to move to another country while being kids, they are adults cant relate  and here im here with literally no one around, with no one who understands literally no fkn one. no one hears or sees the same its just why am i here going through all this and then the wrong DOB just adds to it
