We had an argument and what not and aiman wants laptop and idek what i will do except talk to aysh and it fr just bugs with me soo much but its fine. aysh had to go back in boots today which is a pain idk why its a bit hard for her, i think what her parents will do is a bit amplified in her head but her parents look janooni too especially with the dr thing and then their stupid reputation. 

we are kids worrying about adult things and doing them, dk how this got so hard. its  so hard and underreporting ke they dont even see and the person who knows its underreported doesn't even ask, apparently you can't force but maybe this hooman is just waiting for someone to show willingness to hear, smth more than "i'm here to listen" cuz last 10 people said the same and never did listen. aysh does the same and as soon as i start talking  either she has nothing to say or talks about smth else and ik she forgets shit so i just don't talk about me. 

its been hard being here alone even when i have people, i fear that loneliness will get me again. maybe i come here when i'm lonely idek. 

fr wouldn't leave all these people if smth happened to aysh kasme, i would be a janwar to them give them reasons to die and trust me its not that hard to make a person commit suicide. 

sometimes it bugs me how aysh misses ayub or compares us with him or just mentions him lekin it makes sense, he has done significant shit so i wanna do soo muuch to him and just make him want death  and blow him a kiss when he is finally closing his eyes forever (yk the gradual shutting down) <3
