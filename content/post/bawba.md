Dear bawba,

I understand how stressed uuu are and how difficult life seems to be right now. I want uuu to understand that you're not alone in your emotions and that it's acceptable to every so often not feel okay. It's important to keep in mind that going through challenging times doesn't make uuu a weak or flawed person.

Take some time for yourself to rest and recharge. Do things that bring uuu joy, even if it's just a small thing like reading a book or taking a walk in nature. It's also important to reach out to others for support, whether it be a friend, family member, or a mental health professional. uuu deserve to be heard and to receive the help uuu need to heal.

Be patient and kind to yourself, and keep in mind that healing takes time. uuuu can overcome this challenge because uuu are strong. bawba, don't give up on yourself; keep fighting.

I lub uuu soo soo much meri jaan and remember ke u are not alone and i'm always here to listen to uuu if u ever wanna talk bestie <3

Bawba, come away with me,
From this place you cannot see,
Where skies are not always blue,
And dreams are shattered, not coming true.

I know you feel so all alone,
In this place where you have grown,
But trust me, better days await,
With me, a future full of fate.

I'll take you to a place so bright,
Where every day is filled with light,
We'll dance under stars so bright,
And hold each other through the night.

Just come with me, you'll see,
A world of love and happiness,
Where you'll forever feel blessed.

So come away with me, my love,
From this place you can't escape,
Together we'll find a way,
To a future bright, come what may.
